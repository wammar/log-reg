tools and algorithms 
mailchimp s email genome project analyzes email lists and addresses to find trends in the data that information helps us keep the evil spammers out 
subpoenas 
occasionally we have to disclose information about our customers to meet legal requirements third party disputes are a common example if two parties have a dispute and one of them used mailchimp in a way that s relevant to the dispute then we might get a request for user data whether we say “no way” or comply depends on the subpoena 
unsubscribe links 
it s the law! unsubscribe links are required by the can spam act plus making it easy for people to opt out is the nice thing to do 
7 public information and third parties

social media widgets our websites include social media features like the facebook like button these features may collect information about your ip address and which page you re visiting on our site and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them 
links to third party sites our websites include links to other websites whose privacy practices may be different from mailchimp s if you submit personal information to any of those sites your information is governed by their privacy policies we encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit 
8 content of email campaigns 
when you send email marketing it bounces around from server to server as it crosses the internet along the way server administrators can read what you send email wasn t built for confidential information if you have something confidential to send please don t use mailchimp 
sometimes we review the content of our members email campaigns to make sure they comply with our terms of use to improve that process we have software that helps us find email campaigns that may violate our terms our employees or independent contractors may review those particular email campaigns this benefits all of our members who comply with the terms of use because among other things it reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps to maintain high deliverability 
confidentiality 
our rule of thumb is “never send anything in an email that you wouldn t put on a postcard ” 
your lists 
9 your distribution lists 
your subscriber lists are stored on a secure mailchimp server we don t under any circumstances sell your lists contact people on your lists market to people on your lists steal your lists or share your lists with any other party unless it s required by law if someone on your list complains or contacts us we may then contact that person only authorized employees have access to view distribution lists you may export download your lists from mailchimp at any time as long as we have a copy

it s worth repeating we respect your privacy and your subscribers privacy we d never sell your information or bother anyone on your mailing list 
security 
10 notice of breach of security 
nobody s safe from hackers if a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you or people on your distribution lists then mailchimp will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response

mailchimp accounts require a username and password to log in you must keep your username and password secure and never disclose it to a third party because the information in your distribution lists is so sensitive account passwords are encrypted which means we can t see your passwords we can t resend forgotten passwords either we ll only reset them 
compliance 
12 safe harbor certification

13 accuracy of data transparency and choice 
we do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do that if your data changes like a new email address then you re responsible for notifying us of those changes 
we only store data about you for as long as it s reasonably required to fulfill the purposes that gave us the right to access it in the first place we keep some data indefinitely relating to when and where emails were sent which bounced which resulted in a complaint and similar information because we use it to help us screen out people who violate spam laws and for other reasons explained in this policy
