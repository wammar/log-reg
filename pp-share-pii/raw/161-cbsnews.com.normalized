google privacy issues in forefront again 
the lg nexus 4 android smartphone cbs interactive 
moneywatch getting apps for a google goog android phone is just as easy as adding software to an apple aapl iphone go to the appropriate store and download the apps you want providing a credit card number for the paid ones and nothing for the free apps 
however there is one difference apple keeps the identities of users under wraps if you buy an android app google sends personal information to the developer without explicitly telling you according to an australian developer this is just the latest incarnation of privacy problems that have dogged google over the years 
according to a news com au interview with one such developer the information transfer could be a side effect of google s continuing integration of its properties or it could be a deliberate decision was made to provide that information to developers through the google checkout portal without conveying to users that the policy had been changed

privacy fixes will do nothing for consumers 
smartphone privacy noose tightens on google 
there are a number of potential problems with automatically sending identity and contact information to vendors for example a disgruntled consumer who gave a bad review to an app might find the vendor pressuring them to change the rating people who upload apps with malware would now get information that enable some degree of identity theft 
as developer dan nolan wrote 
if you bought the app on google play even if you cancelled the order i have your email address your suburb and in many instances your full name each google play order is treated as a google wallet transaction and as such software developers get all of the information sans exact address for an order of an app that they would get from the order of something physical 
responding to a moneywatch request for a comment a google spokesperson provided the following statement google wallet shares the information needed to process transactions and this is clearly stated in the google wallet privacy notice 
according to nolan this is a new development in processing payments for android apps 
after doing some more research mr nolan told news com au that sometime before october last year google used to provide developers with alias email addresses of people that had purchased apps in google play rather than their real email address 
sometime around the end of october or november they stopped generating that email and just passed on the real details of the users mr nolan told news com au 
furthermore apple which closely guards the identities of customers of the app store has enabled billions of app downloads without passing such information retailers in general do not share customer identities with their suppliers 
google has a long history of raising privacy concerns including compiling information on people s online habits recording data from wi fi networks and not meeting data protection requirements of some countries
