transfer of personal data to third parties and or other countries 
as a general principle we process personal data in order to facilitate or improve the lego group s offerings and services to you we do purchase supplementary data from public sources to complement our data bases 
we do not process personal data on behalf of third parties nor do we sell personal data to or share personal data with third parties for their own independent use except if you allow us to do so see lego shop at home below 
we do share personal data with third party vendors when it is necessary to provide services that we don t perform ourselves e g shipping of lego® products mailing of lego® club magazines etc 
we also use third party data hosting companies to store personal data collected by us in their servers and to do data validation checks for us see lego id linked accounts below 
we undertake or commission consumer research projects from time to time and we may share personal data with third party research companies for this purpose also such third party research companies may host survey data in their data bases on our behalf 
all data transfers to third party vendors or partners including those listed as examples above will be subject to a written contract between us and the third party vendor or partner in question and the vendor or partner will not have any authority to use such personal data for any purpose other than as instructed by us 
when relevant personal information may be shared among the business units and entities inside the lego group lego entities 
we will disclose personal data when legally obligated to do so under subpoena or court order or for law enforcement purposes for operational security reasons we process mirror personal data in europe and the united states this means that all personal data processed by us is transferred between our facilities in europe and the united states periodically 
personal data collected online from children under the age of 13 
when a child under the age of 13 or such higher age as may be determined by local law in the following the age 13 is used as the common denominator for easy reference contacts the lego group online for example to participate in a contest or to ask a question we will collect that child s email address and the e mail address of the child s parent or guardian we will use the child s e mail address only for the purpose for which it was collected and we will use the e mail address of the parents or guardians only to provide notification about the child s contact with us and to provide notification of the types and uses of personal data collected if and as required by law 
as a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 from whom we have collected personal data you have the right to review and have deleted such personal data and to refuse to permit further collection or use of such personal data to do so you should contact us by clicking here parents and guardians who wish to review personal data concerning their children will be required to specify the usernames and passwords of the children concerned and to provide their own e mail address for verification and contact purposes 
we cannot and will not establish conditions that will require or encourage children to disclose personal data over and above what is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity features on our web sites 
children under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests however if such a child wins notification will be sent to the parent or guardian s e mail address provided by the child when he she enters the contest also we will not ask the child for any personal data beyond e mail addresses without obtaining prior parental consent any personal data obtained from children and parents during contests will be kept until the contest ends and prizes are delivered and then it will be deleted 
if any online activity offered by us will allow children under the age of 13 to reveal personal data publicly for example via un moderated chat rooms or bulletin boards we will obtain parental consent before allowing the child to participate currently all such activities are moderated monitored and or screened 
processing of personal data through lego® channels 
lego id 
general 
we have introduced one common profile platform lego id which is usable across different lego online applications when you have created one lego id for one application it can be used for other applications as well 
a lego id may be created by children and adults alike but where an individual younger than 13 signs up we will as a general rule collect personal data from the parents or legal guardian of the child rather than the child 
in order to create a lego id we will process personal data such as email address and a parent or legal guardian email address if the creator is under the age of 13 birthday country of residence and gender we will also require a password and a username to be created 
the email address is used for sending account notifications and other system related information as needed 
linked accounts 
by linking children s lego id s with parents or legal guardians lego id s we enable more substantial parental control over the child s online activities e g in regards to the lego universe game in doing so however it is extremely important that we can verify the relationship between the child and the parent or legal guardian to whose lego id the child s lego id is to be linked 
for this reason we will process personal data in regards to the parent or legal guardian such as first and last name mailing address date of birth and a more reliable type of offline id number e g driver s license number or social security number personal identification number or the like varying by jurisdiction 
we will transfer these data to an external service provider which will perform the validation for us validation services will be performed under a written contract between us and the service provider 
we will not store personal data collected for the validation in our archives the result we receive back will be a “match” in which case the child and the parent or legal guardian lego id s will be linked or a “no match” in which case the lego id s will not be linked until and unless an appropriate relationship between the child and the applicant has been established otherwise 
the external service provider will process and store the personal data submitted by us strictly for documentation purposes
