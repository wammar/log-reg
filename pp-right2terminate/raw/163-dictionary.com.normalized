children s privacy 
we do allow children under 13 to register for an account but we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 personally identifiable information for example includes a first and last name a home or other physical address an e mail address a telephone number or a social security number 
when we have identified through our age screening process that a child under 13 is trying to register an account with us we immediately hash that user s e mail into a nonreversible character string and discard the e mail then the user s e mail address is only used for password recovery purposes 
generally speaking one way hashing is a way to anonymize or hide data by transforming pieces of information into fixed strings of alphanumeric characters 
for example when the e mail address u13user@dictionary com is hashed the result or hash value might be a8der13ap69 every time that hash function is applied to that e mail address the result will be the same it is called one way hashing because the function allows you to convert the data only one way so while it is possible to convert an e mail address into a hash value it is not possible to convert that value back into the e mail address 
when a child under the age of 13 registers for an account we use hashing to create a password reminder system that does not require us to retain that child s email address to do this we apply the hash function to the email address and associate the resulting hash value not the e mail with the user s account the e mail address is immediately discarded after the hash function is applied 
when the user forgets the password associated with the account we request the original email address hash it and then compare the two hash values if they match we e mail the password reminder to the user and then immediately discard the e mail again 
information from users outside the united states 
if you re outside the united states your information will be sent to and stored in the united states where our servers are located by using our sites and apps you agree to the information collection use and sharing practices described in this privacy policy
