how to avoid receiving spam 
think before you give out your e mail address try to avoid giving your main e mail address on web sites chat rooms newsgroups or to companies there are many places online that provide free e mail accounts you could set up a separate account to use when signing up to an internet service or for online shopping this way your main e mail address cannot be harvested by spammers avoid forwarding chain letters or petitions these lists of addresses can be used by spammers 
never reply to spam this includes the notorious click here to unsubscribe trick while it looks as if you are being given a chance to opt out of receiving further unsolicited e mail in fact you will be letting the spammer know that your e mail address is active leading to yet more spam being sent don t click it just delete the e mail you should also avoid trying to spam the spammers you will end up being blacklisted as a spammer yourself 
blocks and filters your webmail has simple spam blocking features already have a look for the pages on spam or junk mail in the help section of the webmail service if you are downloading emails onto your home pc then email your internet service provider or search their website to find out about spam blocking services they may offer there are various software programs to help you block spam
