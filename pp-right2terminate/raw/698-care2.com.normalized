why then do some people receive spam at an account they have only used on care2 either the spammer did random combinations of letters numbers to guess the address the member sent someone an email message that somehow got distributed or perhaps someone entered their address by mistake somewhere else bottom line if it came from a known spammer we had nothing to do with it spam is bad we hate it and we would never associate ourselves with spammers
