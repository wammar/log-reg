keeping children safe online is important to all of us at this time we believe that it is best to restrict access to our registered member area to users 13 and older so our terms of service restricts users under the age of thirteen from registering for the site participating in any contests at the site or from submitting personal information to us 
if we believe an email has been sent to us from a child under the age of 13 that information is not stored and is used to reply to the child on a one time basis only once the email has been replied to their email address will be deleted from our records if we discover a child under the age of 13 has falsified their age and registered for the site we will cease collecting any further information on that child additionally all data that has been stored in our system about the child will be removed and the child s registration will be revoked
