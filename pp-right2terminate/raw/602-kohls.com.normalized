our philosophy 
kohl s department stores is committed to high standards of behavior on issues of social responsibility through our terms of engagement our policy we hold all of our vendor partners to these same high standards our policy is designed to protect the interests of workers engaged in the manufacture of merchandise procured for kohl s and we select vendor partners who we believe share our commitment to the fair and ethical treatment of employees our compliance philosophy focuses on remediation and continuous improvement 
our policy 
our policy focuses on compliance with local labor laws working conditions and spells out kohl s expectations to our vendor partners regarding wages prohibition of using child or forced labor which includes without limitation prison and slave labor or human trafficking for those purposes respecting the rights of workers to free association health and safety issues and more our policy is posted at www connection kohls com new vendors tab 
we contract with numerous vendor partners who in turn contract with hundreds of manufacturing facilities worldwide to procure merchandise sold in our stores it is critically important to us that each vendor partner s manufacturing facility treats its workers fairly and in compliance with our policy 
we continually monitor social compliance and challenge our vendor partners to protect the health safety and human rights of workers 
back to top 
oversight of our policy 
kohl s organizational structure supports the uniform and objective application of the compliance program to all vendor partners corporate governance personnel are responsible for day to day duties and administration of the compliance program and are independent of the product development and merchandising departments who are responsible for development sourcing and merchandising as a result day to day decisions regarding the social compliance status of potential factories and those factories that are being used to produce merchandise for kohl s are made by employees not involved in actual purchase negotiation 
we expect our vendor partners to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with our policy in their manufacturing facilities that produce merchandise for us whether the facility is operated by them or by one of their subcontractors we require our vendor partners who produce private label and exclusive merchandise for us to identify all manufacturing facilities domestic and foreign that they plan to use to produce such merchandise and to provide us with written certification that each facility will operate in compliance with our policy subcontractors that a vendor partner desires to use in the manufacturing process require our approval 
we recognize that publication of a statement of principles is insufficient to achieve compliance with these principles and that aggressive enforcement of our policy is required to achieve this goal we actively monitor factories in which our merchandise is produced we reserve the right to review all vendor partner facilities including the use of unannounced on site inspections of manufacturing facilities factory monitoring visits are performed by professional independent third party monitors and is ongoing once deemed compliant with our policy factories are monitored periodically based on established risk level to date we have performed in excess of 26 000 monitoring visits to over 5 000 manufacturing facilities in 75 countries around the world to ensure compliance with our policy 
our full compliance audit program includes fifteen different modules

corrective action and remediation 
we require our vendor partners to adopt a corrective action plan whenever possible if noncompliance with kohl s policy is identified we take appropriate action which depending on the severity of the deviation ranges from working with our vendor partner to ensure adequate steps are taken to address deficiencies to canceling affected orders to terminating our relationship with our vendor partner 
follow up evaluations are completed to verify subsequent adherence to our policy when possible we attempt to bring noncompliant facilities into compliance rather than terminate our business relationship 
education and training 
we provide training to vendor partners on our policy and our expectation of compliance we regularly communicate with our vendor partners on compliance issues in addition we conduct numerous individual training sessions for vendor partners to promote understanding and compliance with our requirements the following topics are reviewed during training sessions expectations for suppliers policy definitions best practices site verification methods reporting of facility assessments remediation methods and compliance improvement 
we also conduct internal training sessions for product development and buying office employees on the requirements of our policy on a quarterly basis we provide relevant kohl s employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management training on human trafficking and slavery particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products
