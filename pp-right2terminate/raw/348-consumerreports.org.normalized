surveys 
we have supplementary policies that specifically address information collected through participation in our surveys because we treat survey response information differently we conduct different types of surveys using consumer reports research staff or through research firms we hire we conduct surveys in both print and electronic formats survey data is stored securely and for a limited period of time 
when you participate in one of our surveys we ask for a variety of information including 1 demographic information such as your age gender and geographic location 2 information about yourself and about your experiences with products and services some of which information may be personally identifying and 3 your views and opinions on various topics 
the following principles govern our use of the information we collect through surveys 
first your survey responses will be used only in combination with those of other survey respondents to produce information to help consumers in today s marketplace your individual responses will remain confidential to consumer reports and our agents and service providers and will not be used for non research purposes 
second you will not receive marketing or other non research materials as a result of participating in a survey although it is possible that you may receive such materials as a result of your prior business relationship as a customer or subscriber of consumer reports products or services as a member of consumer reports or as a donor to our organization 
there are two general exceptions to these principles 
1 as part of our quality control efforts if you participate in a survey you may be contacted by consumer reports or its agents to validate that you did take part in the survey and 
2 with your prior affirmative consent if provided in your initial survey response our researchers may follow up with you based on your specific answers to a survey for example if you tell us you have a particular car model and we have additional questions about that car we may select you to participate in a second survey but only if you provided us with affirmative permission to do so in the initial survey 
if you wish to decline participation in future surveys we will honor your opt out request as quickly as possible if you are a print or other offline e g telephone survey participant you may opt out of receiving future offline surveys by calling us at 1 800 234 1645 or by writing to us at
