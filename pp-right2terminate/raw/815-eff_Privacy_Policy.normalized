privacy policy 
the electronic frontier foundation eff is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website as well as our members and activists eff has established this privacy policy to explain what information we collect through our websites and how it is used 
in this policy eff refers to eff staff board members cooperating attorneys interns volunteers and consultants all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep confidential information they receive as part of their assistance to eff 
eff does not sell or rent member donor or website visitor information under any circumstances and we do not share member donor or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law see discussion below 
information gathered by eff s site 
logging for visitors to our website we generally log requests to our website through a program called cryptolog cryptolog described further below and do internal analytical logging also described further below for up to seven days from when the data was collected 
circumstances in which eff may need to log and retain technical information for longer than seven days include when we believe it is reasonably necessary for eff s mission and functionality including situations such as 
site testing 
diagnosis of technical problems 
defending against attacks to the site 
handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal short term circumstances or 
research projects in anonymized form that serve our overall mission to defend freedom online 
in those and similar situations we will delete the information as soon as it is apparent that the information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was retained for more information on eff s position on data logging and techniques we use to anonymize obfuscate aggregate and delete information see our best practices for online service providers 
how cryptolog works cryptolog takes the ip address portion of the request getting logged and encrypts it as well as a chunk of random data the salt using a cryptographic hash function the salt changes every night which should result in making it very difficult for us or anyone else to recover ip addresses from our logs 
how eff internal analytics works eff endeavors to gather sufficient information for analyzing our website and how visitors move within it without compromising the privacy of our visitors eff s internal analytical logging which is separate from the cryptolog logs involves logging for up to seven days a single byte of the ip address as well as the referrer page time stamp page requested user agent language header website visited and a hash of all of this information after seven days we keep only aggregate information from these logs we also geolocate ip addresses before anonymizing them and store only the country 
decentralized observatory of https everywhere if you enable the decentralized observatory feature of the downloaded browswer extension https everywhere we will collect analyze and publish copies of the certificates of ssl tls servers that you connect to these certificates generally do not identify you and we will take reasonable steps to try to avoid collecting specific certificates that may be used to identify you in order to help locate man in the middle attacks the decentralized observatory may also log which isp you observed the certificate through although you can disable this behavior in the observatory settings window
