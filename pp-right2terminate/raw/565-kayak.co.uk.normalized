privacy policy 
our goal is to make kayak the most trusted site in online travel to do this we need your help so any suggestions for improvement can be sent to us directly via the privacy feedback form 
kayak is a search engine that saves you time and money we search the web for the best fares and rates registration on kayak is strictly voluntary you do get some cool information and access to certain great features if you do register but membership is not necessary to get our great rates and fares 
1 what s your sign 
kayak collects personal information personal data to provide you with its search engine services and send you targeted email marketing messages this includes at your discretion your name email address password and certain parts of the travel information you submit when you choose to use the kayak trips service the trips service if you do decide to give us this information you are telling us that this information is both true and accurate also you are telling us that you have the authorisation to provide us with that information our software uses the personal data to personalise and manage the kayak website for you for example our site stores your favourite airport and airlines also the trips service software uses personal data to create and maintain your travel itineraries 
in order to make our site more efficient we may also collect certain personal data such as destination your favourite airport and airlines your travel itineraries and site usage behaviour based on your use of kayak we may use this information to personalise and manage the kayak site for you to display advertising that you find interesting and suppress advertising that you might find boring or annoying for example we might show you travel offers from your home airport but not those from airports that are other places in the country 
to help us debug problems with our software rare as they are we may collect some technical information from your browser software such as mozilla firefox or internet explorer screen resolution and the website that referred you to us we may also use cookies to operate our site and provide the trips service to you for more information please see cookies not the kind you eat with milk 
2 we ll keep you in the loop 
when you choose to register with us kayak logs you in automatically using your email address this makes it easier for you as you don t have to create and remember a login identifier the use of your email address for login also allows kayak the chance to email you a new password in case you forget or lose your old one this is perfectly ok and happens to the best of us particularly those of us who are incredibly busy if you do register with us kayak will save your information and recognise you regardless of where you login from so if you are visiting friends and using their computer we ll know it s you and display your searches and preferences when you do login 
when you register with us kayak gives you the option of receiving emails from us which may include information about our goods and services or those of other companies we think they are useful to you but you may not and can opt out any time our emails are sent from a kayak address and are sent to your real email address if you are a registered user and send email booking confirmations to our trips service we will recognise you if you ve never registered on kayak and you send us email booking confirmations we ll send you an email asking you to register we ll also send you an email if you send us your email booking confirmations but we are unable to recognise the travel provider or otherwise to create your consolidated itinerary every email that we send has an opt out url so you can be unsubscribed when you want we do hate spam at kayak and suspect that you do too 
3 in this case sharing is not caring 
what s yours is yours we won t sell your personal data to anyone there might be an exception in the event kayak itself is sold in this case we would transfer your personal data to our buyers so that they could continue to provide the same great kayak service also if you use the trips service you can send or grant access to your itinerary to your friends and family if you select an itinerary to be displayed on publicly viewable web pages that travel information can be collected and used by others 
however we do share your personal data with certain suppliers that provide services on our behalf and under contractual arrangements with us and with travel suppliers with whom you book travel products that you find on our site we do this in order to operate the site to provide you with the trips service and to enable travel suppliers to fulfil your travel reservations for example we may share your personal data with travel suppliers who fulfil your travel reservations and with other service providers that help us to operate the site by for example providing website hosting visitor analytics or online advertising we only let these service providers use your personal data as necessary to perform their functions and we require them at all times to keep your personal data safe and secure if you want more details about the service providers we use and how they may use your personal data you can request this information by contacting us at 

from time to time we will also share aggregated usage information with others this type of information does not contain your identity or anything personally identifiable to you 
4 if the police come knocking at our door 
kayak may disclose to authorised law enforcement personnel the personal data from anyone who poses a threat to our interests or otherwise make such disclosures that kayak is required to or where kayak believes it should do so by law this might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or those who conduct activities that could bring harm to others we assume that this is not you so please don t worry 
5 you are the boss 
kayak members and site visitors have control over the use of their personal data since you are the boss on kayak you always can change your account settings in the my account pages on kayak how does it feel to be such a big shot 
6 protecting your information 
kayak has a sophisticated security program intended to keep the information stored in our systems protected from unauthorised access we store your information in secure data centres located in the united states our systems are configured with data encryption or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to the highest industry standards we also use secure socket layer ssl technology that protects the data you send over the internet third party security firms review our internal security policies and documentation regularly the bottom line is when it comes to information security we mean business whether your personal data is in the uk or the us
