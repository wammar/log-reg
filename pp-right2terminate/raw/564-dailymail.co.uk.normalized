online behavioural advertising oba 
if you do not want to receive online advertising where this advertising is relevant to your interests or don t want information processed through the use of cookies please see the section below on cookies 
interest based advertising 
cookies used by the a&n media advertising network & associated newspapers 
in order to fund our websites we run advertising on them much of this advertising is run by the a&n media advertising network to make its advertising more relevant and effective the network uses a range of technologies provided by third parties many of which use cookies 
cookies are files that store small amounts of information on your computer or other device for example your mobile phone none of the cookies that we use contain information such as your real name or address so you cannot be identified personally by them some of the cookies used by our websites are set by us and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf 
advertising services 
we gather anonymous information such as on the types of pages visited and keywords searched on in order to build an overall but anonymous picture of interests or preferences based on individual users browsing habits so that we can offer a more personal experience to this information we include information relating to a user s country region and connection type gathered from elements of the ip of the browsing device this practice is a core method used by our group to make our online advertising more efficient for our advertisers and more relevant to consumers 
with permission from our advertisers we also collect information about their sites for use on their advertising campaigns this is often called retargeting or remarketing and involves showing ads to groups of users that have for example visited that client s homepage 
we will also gather information still anonymously on the users that reach an action page on an advertiser s site this allows us to monitor how many sales or actions we achieve for a client and therefore how effective our advertising is 
in order to know how many advertisements we serve how many times these are clicked how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these generate we use cookies when we show advertisements on a page 
as well as our licensed ad servers ads are also often served from third party ad servers such as those of media agencies which all use cookies to track the same metrics as ours do 
for more information about interest based advertising and how to turn this feature off please see our cookies notice below 
ad verification technology 
in order to protect our advertisers brands we often use a technology that scans the page to ascertain that it is safe from profane sensitive & potentially brand negative topics before serving an ad there this process is called ad verification and these technologies use cookies to count ads served those blocked clicked and engaged by a user i e they have hovered over them with their cursor 
for a list of cookies served to specific a&n media websites and mailonline please see our cookies notice below for more information about other cookies please see our privacy policy and cookies faqs 
safeguards and security 
no data transmission over the internet can be entirely secure so we do not guarantee the security of your personal information and or use of the site however we use reasonable endeavours to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorised access or use by using encryption technology in addition to these safeguards your personal information is protected in the uk by the data protection act 1998 this provides that the information which we hold about you should be processed fairly and lawfully should be accurate relevant and not excessive not be retained for longer than is necessary and if applicable be kept up to date for more information on the data protection act 1998 and your related rights please see www ico gov uk 
cookies notice 
you should be aware that when you use our websites mobile sites or mobile apps we may collect information by using cookies 
if you d like to learn how to manage these cookies and opt in and out of different types please see our privacy policy and cookie faq 
what are cookies and how do they work 
cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again so it can recognise you and can then tailor what you see on the screen 

what do you use cookies for 
cookies are an important part of the internet they make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites there are many different uses for cookies but they fall into four main groups 
i cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for 
some cookies are essential so you can move around the website and use its features without these cookies services you ve asked for can t be provided these cookies don t gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you ve been on the internet 
here are some examples of essential cookies 
keeping you logged in during your visit without cookies you might have to log in on every page you go to 
when you add something to the online shopping basket cookies make sure it s still there when you get to the checkout 
some are session cookies which make it possible to navigate through the website smoothly however these are automatically deleted after you close your web browser 
ii improving your browsing experience 
these cookies allow the website to remember choices you make such as your language or region and they provide improved features 
here are a few examples of just some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our websites 
remembering your preferences and settings including marketing preferences 
remembering if you ve filled in a survey so you re not asked to do it again 
remembering if you ve been to the site before if you are a first time user you might see different content to a regular user 
restricting the number of times you re shown a particular advertisment this is sometimes called frequency capping 
showing you information that s relevant to products of ours that you have 
enabling social media components like facebook or twitter 
showing related article links that are relevant to the page you re looking at 
remembering a location you ve entered such as weather forecasts 
iii analytics 
we like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don t get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date it s also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate find their way through our sites and if they get error messages from web pages 
this group of cookies often called analytics cookies are used to gather this information these cookies don t collect information that identifies you the information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else s cookies we can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person s activity analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are on and they are only used to improve how a website works 
some of our websites and some of the emails you might get from us also contain small invisible images known as web beacons or tracking pixels these are used to count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and allows us to measure the effectiveness of its marketing and emails these web beacons are anonymous and don t contain or collect any information that identifies you 
we also use affiliate cookies some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies sites if you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites that other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral this works using a cookie learn how to manage your analytics cookies 
iv showing advertising that is relevant to your interests 
we sell space on some of our sites to advertisers the resulting adverts often contain cookies the advertiser uses the browsing information collected from these cookies to 
restrict the number of times you see the same ad frequency capping 
and help show other ads that are relevant to you while you re on our websites this is often called online behavioural advertising oba oba is a way of using information about your web browsing activity collected by using cookies to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests the oba data collected from cookies you get when you re on our sites is only used to show relevant ads on our sites not on other websites 
sometimes our websites contain ads for our own mailonline or daily mail products these ads use cookies in the same way as described above 
so how does oba work let s look at an example imagine you visit a website about travel that website shows an advert and with that advert you receive a cookie imagine you then visit one of our websites which has an advert from the same advertiser you saw on the travel site the advertiser will give you a new version of the cookie you received on the travel site the advertiser can then use that cookie to recognise that you ve previously been to a travel site and show you a relevant ad 
although the oba data collected uses your browsing activity to understand your interests the data is anonymous and isn t linked to you as a person even if you log in to our websites the oba data is still not linked to you 
neither we nor the companies who show ads on our sites sell data collected from cookies to any other organisations 
it s easy to control interest based advertising and manage your cookies if you want to for more information see our ‘ controlling interest based advertising and other third party cookies page or visit or our privacy policy and cookie faqs 
contacting us and accessing your personal information 
any queries or comments about this privacy notice or if you wish to review or receive copies of the personal information we hold about you should be sent to info@mailonline co uk or write to us at
