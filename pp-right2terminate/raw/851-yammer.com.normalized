privacy 
privacy is fundamental to yammer each company or organization on yammer lives in a separate network that assures the privacy of its members and the user content posted in that network here s how it works 
your network is defined by your company or organization s email domain for example all users who sign up with a “megacorp com” email address would be part of the megacorp com network to join a network you must confirm your email address 
only the people in your network can view the member profiles and feeds 
users can require anyone else in their network to re confirm their email address at any time to prove they still belong in that network you can use this feature to remove former colleagues network administrators can also remove a user at any time 
we don t share your private information with advertisers this includes your email address and the email addresses of others in your network 
companies can impose additional security requirements for their networks such as secure sessions password policies and restricting access to the ip range of their vpn 
companies who claim their network own the user content created by their employees until that point users own their own user content yammer does not own user content network administrators can request that messages posted to their network be securely exported to a company designated destination for archival and backup purposes 
yammer s administrative tools do not allow our employees to view messages in a network access to our database is granted only to our technicians on a case by case basis to troubleshoot specific technical issues or as may be required by law each such instance is logged 
yammer has instituted measures to protect the security of each network s data
