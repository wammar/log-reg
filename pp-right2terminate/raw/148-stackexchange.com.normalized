how we collect information 
we collect information two ways information we get from your use of the network and information you provide to us directly 
your web browser tells us stuff like your approximate location and how you use the site it also bakes us yummy cookies 
information we get from your use of the network is primarily non personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers servers and services like google analytics* typically make available such as the browser type language preference referring site and the time of each visit other non identifying information that we might have access to includes how you use the service e g search queries your approximate location cookies etc 
we try to use this non personal info to help make better q&a sites and to destroy spam we eat the cookies 
we collect this non personally identifying information in order to better understand how visitors use the service and where possible to improve their experience for instance we may monitor the most common content on the network to help identify spam in some cases we may publicly display information that is not personally identifying in the aggregate e g by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the network or may provide it to third parties 
your browser also gives us your ip address which could identify you but we don t use it to do that for real 
when you use the network we also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form of internet protocol ip addresses but we don t use that information to identify you and we handle and disclose these addresses in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information as described below 
if you register an account you may need to give us your email and other personal info but we re not the boss of you and can t make you 
information you provide to us directly certain visitors to the network choose to interact with it in ways that may require them to provide us with personally identifying information the amount and type of information that is provided depends on the nature of the interaction for example we ask visitors who sign up for stackoverflow com to provide a username and email address employers who engage in financial transactions with careers stackoverflow com are asked to provide additional information such as the personal and financial information required to process those transactions in each case we only collect as much information as is necessary or appropriate given the type of interaction we do not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below and you can always refuse to supply personally identifying information with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities 
the non identifying content of a service request may be made public you want to help don t you 
if you send us a request such as emailing us for support we reserve the right to publish it absent any personally identifying information in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or help other users 
if you don t like cookies or have other dietary restrictions please tell your browser 
a cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor s computer and that the visitor s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns we use cookies to help us track visitors use of the network and their preferences if you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer you should set your browser to refuse cookies but should be aware that certain features of the network may not function properly without them 
our servers live in the united states so if you send us your info that s where it s going 
if you are outside the united states you should know that any personally identifiable information you enter into the network will be transferred out of your country and into the united states and possibly to other countries by using the network you consent to such transfer and are representing that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country 
if you re under 13 we want to mind our own business not yours 
we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 if you believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian please contact us at team@stackexchange com if we become aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information we ll delete it 
information you choose to display publicly on the network 
if you decide to post personal information in the public parts of our sites it s… um public 
some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive information about themselves in their normal use of the network this could occur through use of the optional profile fields in question or answer posts or when an individual posts a job history on the careers site information like that which is voluntarily posted in publicly visible parts of the network is considered to be public even if it would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive as such it is not subject to the protocols listed below because we don t control it you do additionally voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally have with regards to that information it also increases your chances of receiving unwanted communications like spam 
information you give to other people 
we re not responsible for any information you give other websites we link to sort of like how your tv maker isn t responsible if you buy a lousy product even if you saw it in an awesome commercial 
this policy only applies to information collected by stack exchange it does not apply to the practices of companies that we don t own or control or employees that we don t manage the network contains links to third party websites and any information you provide to those sites will be covered by any privacy policies they may have please be sure to read the privacy policies of any third party sites you visit it is those sites responsibility to protect any information you give them so we can t be held liable for their wrongful use of your personally identifying information 
how we use information we collect 
we will tell you what we re collecting what we re doing with it and when we might share it with others almost never unless you ask us to 
notice notice is what this privacy policy that you re reading is all about you are reading it right it s important! when we collect your personal information we ll tell you how we re using it any types of third parties to which we might disclose it other than moderators or “agents ” such as vendors or contractors who are only processing such information for us or at our direction and the choices we offer you to limit the use of your information 
we ll tell you all this stuff as soon as you register 
notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide us with personal information or as soon as practicable thereafter and we ll notify you before we use the information for something other than the purpose for which it was originally collected if anything in this policy seems unclear please don t hesitate to contact us at team@stackexchange com so we can address your question and possibly clarify this document 
if we change this policy we ll update this document to keep you in the loop 
although most changes are likely to be minor we may occasionally need to change this policy if we do update it we ll notify you either by posting the new policy on the network or by emailing you the changes or a link to the modified document see the “choice” section below for information about how we ll notify you if we change our policy regarding sensitive information in any case the way we use information you provide will be covered by the privacy policy that was in effect at the time it was collected 
we mostly use your information to customize and improve your and others experience 
here are some of the ways we may use personal information you provide us 
to allow you to register for our web sites online communities and other services and to administer and process those registrations 
to communicate with you about our products services and related issues 
to evaluate the quality of our products and services and to enhance your experience on our web sites 
to help employers find or contact users who post profiles on the careers site 
to maintain and administer our web sites and comply with our legal or internal obligations and policies 
to transfer information to others as described in this policy or to satisfy our legal regulatory compliance or auditing requirements 
choice choice is all about making sure you have the ability to control how we share your personal information with others we almost never share any of your personal information with non agent third parties with one exception where you basically are asking us to do so 
if you post a profile on careers employers can see your name and if you apply for a job we give them your contact info because they can t hire you if they can t contact you 
users who post profiles on our careers site are generally doing so for the express purpose of getting connected with potential employers so if you post a profile on our careers site and choose to make your profile visible to employers your name which is required and most of the other optional information in your profile will be visible to employers searching for candidates that said your contact information email phone and address will not be provided to employers in their candidate searches we will only allow employers to have access to your contact information in two cases both of which are under your control 
if you apply directly for a specific job you will be asked to provide your name and email address and other optional information to the employer 
if an employer finds you through a search and wants to contact you we will ask if you are interested in hearing from them and if you are we will then provide them with your contact information 
outside of when you apply for job listings we don t share your personal info with anyone that could theoretically change in a merger etc but the buyer would still be bound by these rules 
other than on careers we won t share your personal information with non agent third parties unless we are required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property rights or those of third parties or the public at large it is possible that we may on occasion buy or sell assets from or to other companies if that should occur user information is typically one of the assets that get transferred similarly if stack exchange or most of its assets were acquired or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy user information could be transferred or acquired you should be aware that such events can occur and that if it does the buyer may continue to use your personal and non personal information but only as set forth in this policy other than in these rare circumstances stack exchange will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying information to anyone 
in the unlikely event that we should need to collect and transfer your sensitive information we ll ask first 
it s hard to imagine that we would ever consider collecting let alone sharing sensitive information with a non agent third party but if such a day should come we will first give you the opportunity to explicitly consent opt in to such disclosure or to any use of the information for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected or previously authorized 
if you give us your email we may email you but probably not very often we re busy too 
if you are a registered user of the network and have supplied your email address we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features solicit your feedback or just keep you up to date with what s going on with the network we generally use the network to communicate this type of information so we expect to keep this type of communication to a minimum if we do send you information that you did not expressly request we will provide you with a way to request that you don t get any similar notices opt out 
anyone that has access to your info will be required to treat it like we do 
onward transfer prior to providing agents with any personal information we will obtain assurances that they will safeguard it in accordance with this policy examples of assurances that may be provided include 
a commitment that they will handle in the information in accordance with this policy or will provide the same level of protection as required by the safe harbor principles subject to eu directive 95 46 ec “the eu data protection directive” 
safe harbor certification by the agent or being subject to another european commission adequacy finding 
in the unlikely event that we should discover that an agent is using personal information in way that conflicts with this policy we will take all reasonable steps to stop them immediately 
we promise to work hard to keep your info safe and to restrict who can access it 
security all records containing personal or financial information are considered to be our property and are afforded confidential treatment at all times we work hard to protect against the unauthorized access use alteration or destruction of personal or financial information all such electronic information is stored on restricted database servers and is generally kept until such time as you may ask us to edit or delete it as described below we only disclose such information to our employees contractors or affiliates that a need to know that information in order to process it for us or to provide other services and b have agreed not to disclose it to others 
we want to keep your data accurate and up to date so… 
data integrity in addition to assuring you that we will protect your personal information we also want to make sure that it is reliable accurate and up to date in order to do that we provide 
…we ll provide it to you to review within reason 
access upon request we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you you will have the opportunity to correct update modify or delete this information by sending an e mail to team@stackexchange com please note that some information may remain in our records even after you request deletion of your information as permitted by the safe harbor principles additionally there may be limits to the amount of information we can practically provide for example we may limit an individual s access to personal information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual s privacy or where doing so would violate others rights 
enforcement we will conduct internal audits of our compliance with this privacy policy including an annual self assessment our employees take your privacy as seriously as we do and we will take all reasonable measures against any employee found to be in violation of this policy
